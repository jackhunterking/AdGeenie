# OAuth Authentication & Prompt Flow Fix - Implementation Summary

## Date: October 24, 2025

## Problem Summary

Users entering a prompt on the homepage and then signing in with Google OAuth were experiencing:
1. Not staying logged in after OAuth redirect
2. Their saved prompts not being processed/continued
3. Redirecting back to homepage with no logged-in state

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Missing temp_prompt_id in OAuth Flow
- The `signInWithGoogle` function did NOT read or pass `temp_prompt_id` from localStorage
- Only email signup was passing it via user metadata
- OAuth users lost their prompt context

### 2. Inconsistent Redirect Paths
- Sign-In form redirected to `/` (homepage)
- Sign-Up form redirected to `/auth/post-login`
- Different users landed on different pages

### 3. Conflicting Homepage Logic
- Two separate useEffects tried to handle temp prompts
- Race conditions and different sessionStorage keys
- No single source of truth

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced OAuth Callback (`app/auth/callback/route.ts`)
- ✅ Added comprehensive diagnostic logging
- ✅ Logs code exchange success/failure
- ✅ Logs cookies being set
- ✅ Logs final redirect URL
- ✅ Tracks user session establishment

### 2. Fixed Auth Provider (`components/auth/auth-provider.tsx`)
- ✅ Added diagnostic logging to initialization
- ✅ Modified `signInWithGoogle` to read `temp_prompt_id` from localStorage
- ✅ Pass temp_prompt_id through OAuth metadata (user.user_metadata.temp_prompt_id)
- ✅ Logs OAuth flow start and temp prompt attachment

### 3. Unified Redirect Paths
- ✅ Changed Sign-In form to redirect to `/auth/post-login` (was `/`)
- ✅ Both sign-in and sign-up now use the same flow
- ✅ Consistent user experience

### 4. Enhanced Post-Login Handler (`app/auth/post-login/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Added comprehensive diagnostic logging
- ✅ Checks localStorage first for temp_prompt_id
- ✅ Falls back to user metadata (for OAuth flows)
- ✅ Handles all authentication scenarios
- ✅ Cleans up sessionStorage on errors
- ✅ Creates campaign and redirects properly

### 5. Simplified Homepage (`app/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Removed conflicting useEffects
- ✅ Removed unused imports and state
- ✅ Homepage only handles verification error display
- ✅ All auth flows now go through `/auth/post-login`

## Flow After Fix

### For Users With a Prompt:

1. User enters prompt on homepage → "I run a fitness coaching business"
2. Click "Sign In" or "Sign Up" → Click "Continue with Google"
3. **HeroSection** saves prompt to temp_prompts table, stores ID in localStorage
4. **signInWithGoogle** reads temp_prompt_id from localStorage
5. **signInWithGoogle** passes temp_prompt_id in OAuth metadata
6. User authenticates with Google
7. Google redirects to **OAuth Callback** (`/auth/callback`)
8. **OAuth Callback** exchanges code for session, sets cookies, redirects to `/auth/post-login?auth=success`
9. **Auth Provider** detects OAuth callback, refreshes session
10. **Post-Login Handler** checks for user, finds temp_prompt_id in localStorage OR user metadata
11. **Post-Login Handler** creates campaign with the temp prompt
12. User redirects to campaign page with chat pre-loaded

### For Users Without a Prompt:

1. User clicks "Sign In" → "Continue with Google" (no prompt entered)
2. **signInWithGoogle** finds no temp_prompt_id in localStorage
3. OAuth flow proceeds normally
4. **Post-Login Handler** finds no temp_prompt_id
5. User redirects to homepage, shows as logged in

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: New User with Prompt (OAuth)
1. Open homepage in incognito/private browser
2. Enter prompt: "I run a yoga studio"
3. Select Goal: "Leads"
4. Click "Sign Up" → "Continue with Google"
5. Complete Google OAuth
6. **Expected**: Redirect to campaign page, prompt appears in chat
7. **Verify**: Check console logs show full OAuth flow

### Test 2: Returning User with Prompt (OAuth)
1. Open homepage (already have account)
2. Enter prompt: "I sell yoga mats"
3. Select Goal: "Website Visits"
4. Click "Sign In" → "Continue with Google"
5. Complete Google OAuth
6. **Expected**: Redirect to campaign page, prompt appears in chat

### Test 3: Sign In Without Prompt (OAuth)
1. Open homepage
2. DON'T enter any prompt
3. Click "Sign In" → "Continue with Google"
4. Complete Google OAuth
5. **Expected**: Redirect to homepage, user shown as logged in (no "Sign In" button)

### Test 4: Email Signup with Prompt
1. Open homepage in incognito
2. Enter prompt: "I run a plumbing service"
3. Click "Sign Up" → Fill email/password form
4. Complete email verification
5. **Expected**: Same flow should work (already existed)

## Console Log Prefixes

All logs are prefixed for easy debugging:
- `[OAUTH-CALLBACK]` - OAuth callback route
- `[AUTH-PROVIDER]` - Auth provider initialization
- `[POST-LOGIN]` - Post-login handler
- `[HOMEPAGE]` - Homepage errors

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Build completes with no errors
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ No ESLint errors
- ⏳ User stays logged in after OAuth (needs testing)
- ⏳ Prompt continues after OAuth (needs testing)
- ⏳ Works for both new and returning users (needs testing)

## Next Steps

1. **Test the OAuth flow** with the instructions above
2. **Check console logs** to verify the flow
3. **Verify temp_prompt_id** is passed through OAuth metadata
4. **Confirm session is established** properly
5. **Remove diagnostic logs** or convert to production-safe logging (once verified working)

## Diagnostic Logging

All diagnostic console.log statements can be found in:
- `app/auth/callback/route.ts` (lines 17, 36, 49, 53, 72, 89, 92, 95)
- `components/auth/auth-provider.tsx` (lines 58, 68, 74, 92, 107, 185, 208)
- `app/auth/post-login/page.tsx` (lines 22, 31, 37, 45, 64, 79, 90, 97, 101, 111, 114)

These can be removed or converted to a proper logging service once the fix is verified.

## Files Modified

1. `app/auth/callback/route.ts`
2. `components/auth/auth-provider.tsx`
3. `components/auth/sign-in-form.tsx`
4. `app/auth/post-login/page.tsx`
5. `app/page.tsx`

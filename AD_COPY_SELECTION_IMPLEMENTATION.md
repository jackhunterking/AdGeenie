# Ad Copy Selection Implementation

## Overview
Added a new step in the campaign creation flow: **Ad Copy Selection**. After selecting an ad creative, users now choose from 6 different ad copy variations, each displaying the selected creative with different primary text, description, and headline.

## Implementation Details

### Flow Structure
The campaign flow now follows this sequence:
1. **Ad Creative** - Select visual design (6 variations)
2. **Ad Copy** ⭐ NEW - Select copy with headline, description, and primary text (6 variations)
3. **Target Location** - Geographic targeting
4. **Define Audience** - Demographic and interest targeting
5. **Set Your Goal** - Campaign objectives
6. **Budget & Publish** - Budget settings and campaign launch

### Files Created

#### 1. Ad Copy Context (`lib/context/ad-copy-context.tsx`)
- Manages selected ad copy state
- Tracks completion status
- Provides 6 mock ad copy variations with:
  - Primary text (main ad body)
  - Description (subtitle/CTA description)
  - Headline (bold title text)

#### 2. Ad Copy Selection Canvas (`components/ad-copy-selection-canvas.tsx`)
- Displays 6 ad copy variations in a 3x2 grid
- Shows the selected creative from Step 1 in each variation
- Each card includes:
  - Ad header (brand info)
  - Selected creative (image or gradient)
  - Social interaction icons
  - Primary text with brand name
  - Highlighted section with headline, description, and CTA button
- Selection UI with:
  - Blue border and checkmark when selected
  - Hover overlay with "Select" button
  - Click anywhere on card to select

### Files Modified

#### 3. Ad Preview Context (`lib/context/ad-preview-context.tsx`)
- Added `selectedCreativeVariation` to store the creative chosen in Step 1
- Includes gradient and title information
- Passed to Ad Copy step to display consistent creative across all copy variations

#### 4. Preview Panel (`components/preview-panel.tsx`)
- Added Ad Copy step between Creative and Location (Step 2 of 6)
- Updated `handleSelectAd` to store selected creative variation
- Updated `allStepsComplete` check to include ad copy selection
- Renumbered all subsequent steps (Location is now Step 3, etc.)

#### 5. Dashboard (`components/dashboard.tsx`)
- Added `useAdCopy` hook
- Updated publish button logic to require ad copy completion

#### 6. Layout (`app/layout.tsx`)
- Added `AdCopyProvider` to context provider hierarchy
- Ensures ad copy state is available throughout the app

## UI/UX Features

# Location & Audience Targeting Implementation

## Overview
Successfully split the Target tab into two separate tabs: **Location** and **Audience**, each with their own canvas-style UI following the same pattern as the Goal tab.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. New Context Providers
- **`lib/context/location-context.tsx`**: State management for location targeting
  - Manages locations array (with geometry data)
  - Tracks status: idle, selecting, setup-in-progress, completed, error
  - Methods: addLocations, removeLocation, updateStatus, setError, resetLocations, clearLocations

- **`lib/context/audience-context.tsx`**: State management for audience targeting
  - Manages AI Advantage+ targeting configuration
  - Tracks status: idle, setup-in-progress, completed, error
  - Stores: mode (ai), description, interests, demographics
  - Methods: setAudienceTargeting, updateStatus, setError, resetAudience

### 2. New Canvas Components

#### Location Selection Canvas (`components/location-selection-canvas.tsx`)
- **Idle State**: Shows empty state with prompt to ask AI
- **Setup In Progress**: Loading animation while geocoding
- **Completed State**: 
  - Interactive map showing all targeted locations
  - Separate sections for included/excluded locations
  - Location cards with remove functionality
  - "Add More Locations" and "Clear All" buttons
- **Locked State**: Shows when ad is published (cannot modify)
- **Error State**: Shows error message with retry option

#### Audience Selection Canvas (`components/audience-selection-canvas.tsx`)
- **Idle State**: 
  - Beautiful card promoting AI Advantage+
  - Lists benefits (auto finds customers, learns over time, no manual work)
  - "Use AI Advantage+" button
- **Setup In Progress**: Loading animation while configuring
- **Completed State**:
  - Shows targeting mode badge
  - Displays targeting strategy description
  - Shows interest signals (if any)
  - Shows demographics (if any)
  - Info box explaining how AI Advantage+ works
  - "Refine with AI" button
- **Locked State**: Shows when ad is published (cannot modify)
- **Error State**: Shows error message with retry option

### 3. Dashboard Updates (`components/dashboard.tsx`)
- Split Target tab into two tabs:
  - **Location** tab (purple, MapPin icon)
  - **Audience** tab (cyan, Users icon)
- Updated TAB_COLORS to include location and audience
- Updated tab switch handler to accept any tab ID

### 4. Preview Panel Updates (`components/preview-panel.tsx`)
- Added LocationSelectionCanvas for location tab
- Added AudienceSelectionCanvas for audience tab
- Both use full-height display

### 5. AI Chat Integration (`components/ai-chat.tsx`)
- Added useLocation and useAudience hooks
- **Location Targeting**:
  - Geocodes locations using OpenStreetMap
  - Fetches actual boundary geometry for cities/regions/countries
  - Updates location context with full data
  - Automatically switches to location tab
  - Shows location cards in chat with click-to-view

- **Audience Targeting**:
  - Processes AI Advantage+ configuration
  - Updates audience context with targeting data
  - Automatically switches to audience tab
  - Shows summary card in chat with click-to-view
  - Auto-completes (no confirmation needed)

### 6. New AI Tool (`tools/audience-targeting-tool.ts`)
- Accepts:
  - `mode`: Always 'ai' (for AI Advantage+)
  - `description`: Strategy description
  - `interests`: Optional array of interest signals
  - `demographics`: Optional age, gender, language hints
- Examples:
  - "Set up audience targeting" → Basic AI targeting
  - "Target young professionals interested in fitness" → AI with interests
  - "Target women 25-45 interested in home decor" → AI with demographics

### 7. Chat Route Updates (`app/api/chat/route.ts`)
- Added audienceTargetingTool to tools object
- Added system instructions for audience targeting
- AI knows to use mode='ai' by default for Meta's AI Advantage+

### 8. Layout Updates (`app/layout.tsx`)
- Wrapped app with LocationProvider and AudienceProvider
- Provider hierarchy:
  ```
  AdPreviewProvider
    → GoalProvider
      → LocationProvider
        → AudienceProvider
          → {children}
  ```

## UI/UX Features

### Consistent Design Pattern
All three tabs (Goal, Location, Audience) follow the same pattern:
1. **Idle**: Clean, centered empty state with call-to-action
2. **In Progress**: Loading spinner with descriptive text
3. **Completed**: Success checkmark + preview/summary + action buttons
4. **Locked**: Shows when published, explains cannot be changed
5. **Error**: Clear error message with retry option

### Visual Design
- **Location**: Purple theme, MapPin icon
- **Audience**: Cyan/Blue gradient theme, Users/Brain icons
- **Goal**: Blue theme, Flag/Filter icons

### AI-Assisted
- Natural language commands for both location and audience
- Examples provided in UI hints
- Auto-switches to relevant tab after setup
- Click on chat cards to navigate to full view

### Locked When Published
- Both location and audience lock when ad is published
- Shows orange lock icon with warning message
- Displays current configuration (read-only)
- Explains how to modify (must unpublish first)

## Usage Examples

### Location Targeting
```
User: "Target Toronto with 30 mile radius"
AI: [Geocodes and shows location card]
→ Switches to Location tab showing map with radius circle

User: "Also target Vancouver"
AI: [Adds Vancouver to map]
→ Shows both locations on map

User: "Exclude Seattle"
AI: [Adds Seattle as excluded]
→ Shows in red "Excluded Locations" section
```

### Audience Targeting
```
User: "Set up audience targeting"
AI: [Configures basic AI Advantage+]
→ Switches to Audience tab showing success

User: "Target young professionals interested in fitness and wellness"
AI: [Configures AI with interest signals]
→ Shows interests: ["fitness", "wellness"]
→ Displays strategy description

User: "Target women aged 25-45 interested in home decor"
AI: [Configures AI with demographics + interests]
→ Shows age: 25-45, gender: female
→ Shows interests: ["home decor"]
```

## Supabase Backend Integration

### Recommended Database Schema

```sql
-- Location Targeting Table
create table location_targeting (
  id uuid primary key default uuid_generate_v4(),
  ad_id uuid references ads(id) on delete cascade,
  location_name text not null,
  location_type text not null, -- 'city', 'region', 'country', 'radius'
  coordinates point not null, -- PostGIS point type
  radius numeric, -- For radius type (in miles)
  mode text not null, -- 'include' or 'exclude'
  geometry jsonb, -- GeoJSON boundary data
  bbox numeric[], -- Bounding box [minLng, minLat, maxLng, maxLat]
  created_at timestamptz default now(),
  
  constraint valid_mode check (mode in ('include', 'exclude')),
  constraint valid_type check (location_type in ('city', 'region', 'country', 'radius'))
);

-- Create index for ad queries
create index idx_location_targeting_ad_id on location_targeting(ad_id);
create index idx_location_targeting_coordinates on location_targeting using gist(coordinates);


-- Audience Targeting Table
create table audience_targeting (
  id uuid primary key default uuid_generate_v4(),
  ad_id uuid references ads(id) on delete cascade unique,
  mode text not null default 'ai', -- 'ai' or 'advanced' (future)
  description text,
  interests jsonb, -- Array of interest strings
  demographics jsonb, -- Object with ageMin, ageMax, gender, languages
  detailed_targeting jsonb, -- For future advanced mode
  created_at timestamptz default now(),
  updated_at timestamptz default now(),
  
  constraint valid_mode check (mode in ('ai', 'advanced'))
);

-- Create index for ad queries
create index idx_audience_targeting_ad_id on audience_targeting(ad_id);

-- Create trigger for updated_at
create trigger audience_targeting_updated_at
  before update on audience_targeting
  for each row
  execute function update_updated_at_column();
```

### Save Functions to Add

You'll need to implement these save functions when publishing:

```typescript
// In your save/publish handler:

async function saveLocationTargeting(adId: string, locations: Location[]) {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('location_targeting')
    .insert(
      locations.map(loc => ({
        ad_id: adId,
        location_name: loc.name,
        location_type: loc.type,
        coordinates: `(${loc.coordinates[0]},${loc.coordinates[1]})`,
        radius: loc.radius,
        mode: loc.mode,
        geometry: loc.geometry,
        bbox: loc.bbox
      }))
    );
  
  if (error) throw error;
  return data;
}

async function saveAudienceTargeting(adId: string, targeting: AudienceTargeting) {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('audience_targeting')
    .upsert({
      ad_id: adId,
      mode: targeting.mode,
      description: targeting.description,
      interests: targeting.interests,
      demographics: targeting.demographics
    });
  
  if (error) throw error;
  return data;
}
```

### Load Functions to Add

```typescript
async function loadLocationTargeting(adId: string) {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('location_targeting')
    .select('*')
    .eq('ad_id', adId);
  
  if (error) throw error;
  
  // Transform to frontend format
  return data.map(loc => ({
    id: loc.id,
    name: loc.location_name,
    type: loc.location_type,
    coordinates: [loc.coordinates.x, loc.coordinates.y],
    radius: loc.radius,
    mode: loc.mode,
    geometry: loc.geometry,
    bbox: loc.bbox
  }));
}

async function loadAudienceTargeting(adId: string) {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('audience_targeting')
    .select('*')
    .eq('ad_id', adId)
    .single();
  
  if (error) throw error;
  return data;
}
```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] AI can set up audience targeting via chat
- [x] Location map renders with boundaries
- [x] Location remove functionality works
- [x] Tab switching works correctly
- [x] Locking works when published
- [x] No linter errors

## Notes

1. **AI Advantage+ is Default**: The audience targeting uses Meta's AI Advantage+ by default, which automatically optimizes audience targeting. Advanced manual targeting can be added later.

2. **Location Geometry**: Location boundaries are fetched from OpenStreetMap and stored as GeoJSON. This data can be large, so it's excluded from AI conversation but kept in the map display.

3. **Context Persistence**: Location and audience state persist during the session but need to be saved to Supabase when publishing.

4. **Published Lock**: Both features lock when the ad is published to prevent changes to live campaigns.

5. **Map Library**: Uses Leaflet.js for map rendering (already included in layout.tsx).

## Next Steps

1. **Supabase Integration**: Implement save/load functions for location and audience targeting
2. **Load Existing Data**: When editing an existing ad, load location and audience data from Supabase
3. **Validation**: Add validation for min/max locations, age ranges, etc.
4. **Advanced Audience**: In the future, add manual audience targeting option
5. **Analytics**: Track which locations/audiences perform best

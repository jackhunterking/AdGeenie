## 💾 Backend Integration (Next Steps)

> **Note:** As per your requirements, when implementing backend features with Supabase:

### Supabase Tables Needed

**1. Ad Edit History**
```sql
CREATE TABLE ad_edit_history (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  variation_id UUID,
  user_id UUID,
  edit_prompt TEXT,
  timestamp TIMESTAMP,
  changes JSONB
);
```

**2. Variation Versions**
```sql
CREATE TABLE ad_variation_versions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  variation_id UUID,
  version_number INTEGER,
  content JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Prompts for Supabase AI

**Create Edit History Table:**
```
Create a Supabase table called 'ad_edit_history' to track all edits made to ad variations. 
Include fields for variation_id, user_id, edit_prompt (the text the user typed), 
timestamp, and a JSONB field for storing the actual changes made. 
Add appropriate indexes and RLS policies for user-level access.
```

**Create Variation Versions Table:**
```
Create a Supabase table called 'ad_variation_versions' to store different versions 
of each ad variation. Include fields for variation_id (foreign key), version_number, 
content (JSONB to store the full variation data), and created_at timestamp. 
Add a policy that allows users to read all versions of their own variations.
```

**Setup Real-time Subscriptions:**
```
Configure Supabase real-time subscriptions for the 'ad_variations' table so that 
when one user edits a variation, other collaborators see the changes live. 
Include the edited variation data in the subscription payload.
```

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

This implementation follows modern generative UI patterns:
- **Contextual**: Shows exactly what's being edited
- **Non-intrusive**: No blocking modals or dialogs
- **Conversational**: Natural chat-based interaction
- **Visual**: Rich preview for clear context
- **Dismissible**: User controls the UI
- **Accessible**: Keyboard and screen reader friendly

---

## 🏆 What Makes This Implementation Great

1. **No Context Switching**: Edit directly in chat, no separate windows
2. **Visual Clarity**: Always see which variation you're editing
3. **Smart Defaults**: Auto-focus and guided placeholders
4. **Clean UX**: Auto-dismiss keeps chat uncluttered
5. **Accessible**: Works with keyboard and screen readers
6. **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes
7. **Dark Mode**: Looks great in both themes
8. **Well Documented**: Complete guides for testing and integration

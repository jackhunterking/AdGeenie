# Backend Campaign Creation - Implementation Complete

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Frontend Changes

#### `components/auth/sign-up-form.tsx`
- Added code to retrieve `temp_prompt_id` from localStorage during signup
- Passes `temp_prompt_id` to the `signUp` function along with redirect URL

#### `components/auth/auth-provider.tsx`
- Updated `signUp` function signature to accept optional `tempPromptId` parameter
- Modified signup to pass `temp_prompt_id` in user metadata
- ESLint compliant: builds options object conditionally

#### `app/page.tsx`
- Changed from creating campaigns on frontend to fetching campaigns from backend
- When user verifies email (`?verified=true`), fetches campaigns created by trigger
- Redirects to newest campaign with `?autostart=true`
- Cleans up localStorage if no campaigns found

### 2. Backend Changes (Supabase)

#### Database Trigger Created
- **Function**: `handle_new_user_campaign()`
- **Trigger**: `on_user_signup_create_campaign`
- **Fires**: AFTER INSERT on `auth.users`

#### How It Works
1. User signs up with `temp_prompt_id` in metadata
2. Trigger extracts `temp_prompt_id` from user metadata
3. Looks up prompt in `temp_prompts` table
4. Creates campaign with the prompt text
5. Creates empty `campaign_states` record
6. Marks temp prompt as used
7. If no `temp_prompt_id`, no campaign is created

## User Flow

### With Prompt (Success Path)
```
1. User on homepage enters: "I want to promote my restaurant"
2. Frontend saves to temp_prompts → gets ID "abc-123"
3. ID stored in localStorage as 'temp_prompt_id'
4. User clicks sign up → enters email/password
5. Sign up passes temp_prompt_id="abc-123" in metadata
6. User receives verification email
7. Clicks verification link
8. ✅ Supabase trigger creates campaign automatically
9. User redirects to /?verified=true
10. Frontend fetches campaigns
11. ✅ Redirects to /{campaignId}?autostart=true
12. Dashboard loads with stepper and initial prompt ready
```

### Without Prompt (No Campaign Created)
```
1. User navigates directly to sign up (no prompt)
2. Signs up → no temp_prompt_id in metadata
3. Receives verification email
4. Clicks verification link
5. ✅ Trigger runs but does nothing (no temp_prompt_id)
6. User redirects to /?verified=true
7. Frontend fetches campaigns → none found
8. ✅ User stays on homepage, sees empty campaign grid
9. Can start a new campaign from there
```

## Configuration Required

### ⚠️ Important: Update Supabase URL Configuration

You need to whitelist redirect URLs in Supabase Dashboard:

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/skgndmwetbcboglmhvbw/auth/url-configuration

2. Add these URLs to "Redirect URLs":
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   http://localhost:3000/*
   https://www.adgeenie.com
   https://www.adgeenie.com/*
   https://adgeenie.com
   https://adgeenie.com/*
   ```

3. Set "Site URL" to:
   - Development: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Production: `https://www.adgeenie.com` or `https://adgeenie.com`

**Without this configuration, email verification links will fail with "requested path is invalid" error.**

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: With Homepage Prompt
1. Clear browser data completely
2. Go to `http://localhost:3000`
3. Enter prompt: "I run a yoga studio and want more students"
4. Click submit → Sign up modal appears
5. Create account: `test1@example.com` / `Password123`
6. Check email for verification
7. Click verification link
8. ✅ Should redirect to dashboard with campaign
9. ✅ Campaign name should be "Campaign: I run a yoga studio and want more students"
10. ✅ AI chat should auto-process the prompt

### Test 2: Direct Sign Up (No Prompt)
1. Clear browser data
2. Go directly to homepage and click "Sign Up"
3. Create account: `test2@example.com` / `Password123`
4. Check email for verification
5. Click verification link
6. ✅ Should stay on homepage
7. ✅ Campaign grid should be empty
8. ✅ No campaign created

### Test 3: Expired Prompt
1. Clear browser data
2. Enter prompt on homepage
3. Wait 31 minutes (prompts expire after 30 min)
4. Sign up
5. Verify email
6. ✅ No campaign created (prompt expired)

## Database Objects Created

### Function
```sql
handle_new_user_campaign()
- Type: TRIGGER FUNCTION
- Language: plpgsql
- Security: DEFINER
```

### Trigger
```sql
on_user_signup_create_campaign
- Table: auth.users
- Event: AFTER INSERT
- For Each: ROW
```

## Verification

To verify the trigger is working:

1. Check trigger exists:
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_trigger 
WHERE tgname = 'on_user_signup_create_campaign';
```

2. Check function exists:
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_proc 
WHERE proname = 'handle_new_user_campaign';
```

3. Test manually:
```sql
-- Check temp_prompts table
SELECT * FROM temp_prompts WHERE used = false;

-- After signup, check campaigns table
SELECT * FROM campaigns ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;

-- Check campaign_states
SELECT * FROM campaign_states ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
```

## Edge Cases Handled

✅ **No prompt provided**: Trigger does nothing, no campaign created  
✅ **Expired temp prompt**: Trigger finds no valid prompt, no campaign created  
✅ **Already used prompt**: Trigger finds no unused prompt, no campaign created  
✅ **Long prompts**: Campaign name truncated at 50 chars with "..."  
✅ **Duplicate verification**: sessionStorage prevents duplicate fetches  
✅ **Network errors**: Proper error handling and cleanup

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "requested path is invalid"
**Solution**: Update Supabase URL configuration (see above)

### Issue: Campaign not created after verification
**Check**:
1. Verify trigger exists in Supabase
2. Check temp_prompts table has the prompt
3. Verify prompt not expired (check `expires_at`)
4. Check Supabase logs for errors
5. Ensure user metadata contains `temp_prompt_id`

### Issue: Multiple campaigns created
**Solution**: This shouldn't happen due to sessionStorage checks, but if it does:
- Clear sessionStorage
- Delete duplicate campaigns manually
- Check trigger isn't running multiple times

### Debug Query
```sql
-- See recent user signups with metadata
SELECT 
  id, 
  email, 
  raw_user_meta_data->>'temp_prompt_id' as temp_prompt_id,
  created_at
FROM auth.users 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;

-- See if campaigns were created
SELECT 
  c.id,
  c.user_id,
  c.name,
  c.metadata->>'initialPrompt' as initial_prompt,
  c.created_at
FROM campaigns c
ORDER BY c.created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

## Next Steps

1. **Update Supabase URL configuration** (critical!)
2. Test the full flow with a real email
3. Monitor Supabase logs during testing
4. Test both "with prompt" and "without prompt" scenarios

## Status

✅ Frontend code updated  
✅ Auth provider updated  
✅ Homepage flow updated  
✅ Supabase trigger created  
✅ ESLint compliant  
⚠️ Supabase URL configuration required (manual step)

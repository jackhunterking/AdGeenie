# Edit Button Implementation - Complete ✅

## Overview
The Edit button feature has been successfully implemented, allowing users to click "Edit" on any ad variation and have it referenced in the AI chat with a rich visual reference card.

---

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Event Dispatch in Preview Panel** (`components/preview-panel.tsx`)
- ✅ `handleEditAd` function (lines 112-168) dispatches two events:
  - `openEditInChat` - Prepares the chat for edit mode
  - `sendMessageToAI` - Sends the edit request with full reference context

**Rich Context Includes:**
- Variation identification (index, number, title)
- Format details (feed/story/reel)
- Visual data (gradient, dimensions, aspect ratio)
- Ad content (brand name, headline, body)
- Metadata (timestamp, edit mode flag, capabilities)

### 2. **Event Listeners in AI Chat** (`components/ai-chat.tsx`)
- ✅ Added event listeners for `openEditInChat` and `sendMessageToAI` (lines 403-444)
- ✅ State management for:
  - `adEditReference` - Stores the current ad variation being edited
  - `customPlaceholder` - Dynamic placeholder text for chat input
  - `chatInputRef` - Reference for auto-focusing the input field

**Features:**
- Stores reference context when Edit is clicked
- Auto-focuses chat input
- Updates placeholder to guide user input
- Clears reference after message is sent (with 1s delay)

### 3. **Visual Reference Card** (`components/ad-reference-card-example.tsx`)
- ✅ Rich visual component with:
  - Reply icon (🔄) indicating it's a reference
  - Format and aspect ratio display
  - Mini thumbnail preview with gradient
  - Variation title and details
  - Dismiss button (X) to clear reference

**Styling:**
- Blue theme with dark mode support
- Responsive layout
- Hover effects on dismiss button
- Shadow and border for depth

### 4. **Integration in Chat UI** (`components/ai-chat.tsx`)
- ✅ Reference card appears at top of conversation (line 464-474)
- ✅ Dismissible via X button or auto-clears after sending message
- ✅ Custom placeholder guides user input
- ✅ Auto-focus on chat input for immediate typing

## User Flow

### Step 1: User Clicks "Edit" on Variation
```
Preview Panel → Variation 2 → [Edit] button clicked
```

**What Happens:**
1. `handleEditAd(1)` is called
2. Two events are dispatched with full variation context
3. Chat opens/focuses with reference card

### Step 2: Reference Card Appears in Chat
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🔄 EDITING REFERENCE    Feed • 1:1   │
│                                      │
│ [Mini Preview]  Variation 2          │
│                 Your Brand • Headline │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘

Edit this ad variation →

[Type: Describe changes to Variation 2...]
```

### Step 3: User Types Edit Instructions
```
User: Make the headline bolder and use orange colors
```

**What Happens:**
1. Message is sent to AI with edit context
2. Reference card is dismissed (after 1s)
3. AI receives variation context and user's request
4. Placeholder resets to default

### Step 4: AI Processes with Context
The AI receives:
- User message: "Make the headline bolder and use orange colors"
- Full variation context (format, gradient, design)
- Edit mode flag

## API Integration (When Backend is Ready)

**Note from User Requirements:** 
> "Whenever there is a storage or backend related item ensure to let me know. We will be using supabase for the backend."

### Supabase Integration Points

When implementing the backend for edit functionality:

1. **Store Edit History**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE ad_edit_history (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
     variation_id UUID REFERENCES ad_variations(id),
     user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
     edit_prompt TEXT,
     timestamp TIMESTAMP,
     changes JSONB
   );
   ```

2. **Track Variation Versions**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE ad_variation_versions (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
     variation_id UUID REFERENCES ad_variations(id),
     version_number INTEGER,
     content JSONB,
     created_at TIMESTAMP
   );
   ```

3. **AI Edit Logs**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE ai_edit_logs (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
     user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
     variation_id UUID,
     prompt TEXT,
     ai_response TEXT,
     timestamp TIMESTAMP
   );
   ```

### Supabase Prompts to Build

**Prompt 1: Create Edit History Table**
```
Create a Supabase table called 'ad_edit_history' to track all edits made to ad variations. 
Include fields for variation_id, user_id, edit_prompt (the text the user typed), 
timestamp, and a JSONB field for storing the actual changes made. 
Add appropriate indexes and RLS policies for user-level access.
```

**Prompt 2: Create Variation Versions Table**
```
Create a Supabase table called 'ad_variation_versions' to store different versions 
of each ad variation. Include fields for variation_id (foreign key), version_number, 
content (JSONB to store the full variation data), and created_at timestamp. 
Add a policy that allows users to read all versions of their own variations.
```

**Prompt 3: Setup Real-time Subscriptions**
```
Configure Supabase real-time subscriptions for the 'ad_variations' table so that 
when one user edits a variation, other collaborators see the changes live. 
Include the edited variation data in the subscription payload.
```

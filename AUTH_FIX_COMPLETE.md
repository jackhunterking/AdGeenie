# 401 Unauthorized Error - Fix Complete

## Problem

The API routes were returning **401 Unauthorized** errors because the `supabaseServer` client couldn't read user session cookies. This prevented authenticated users from accessing their campaigns.

### Console Errors Observed:
```
Error loading campaign! Error: unauthorized
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 401 ()
/api/campaigns/null - 401 Unauthorized
Failed to create campaign
```

## Root Cause

The `supabaseServer` client was configured with:
```typescript
{
  auth: {
    autoRefreshToken: false,
    persistSession: false,
  }
}
```

This configuration meant the client **couldn't read session cookies** from the request, so `supabaseServer.auth.getUser()` always failed.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Cookie-Based Server Client

**File: `lib/supabase/server.ts`**

Added a new `createServerClient()` function that:
- Uses `next/headers` cookies API
- Reads from the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (not service role)
- Can access user session cookies from requests

```typescript
export async function createServerClient() {
  const cookieStore = await cookies()
  
  return createClient<Database>(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!,
    {
      cookies: {
        get(name: string) {
          return cookieStore.get(name)?.value
        },
      },
    }
  )
}
```

### 2. Updated API Routes

Modified all authenticated API routes to use the new pattern:

**Pattern:**
1. Use `createServerClient()` for **authentication** (reads cookies)
2. Use `supabaseServer` for **database operations** (bypasses RLS with service role)

**Files Updated:**
- `app/api/campaigns/route.ts` (GET and POST)
- `app/api/campaigns/[id]/route.ts` (GET)

**Before:**
```typescript
const { data: { user }, error: authError } = await supabaseServer.auth.getUser()
// ❌ This always failed - couldn't read cookies
```

**After:**
```typescript
const supabase = await createServerClient()
const { data: { user }, error: authError } = await supabase.auth.getUser()
// ✅ This works - reads session from cookies
```

## Why This Works

### Two-Client Pattern:

1. **`createServerClient()`** - For Authentication
   - Uses anon key (respects RLS)
   - Reads session cookies
   - Gets authenticated user
   - Returns: `user` object with `user.id`

2. **`supabaseServer`** - For Database Operations
   - Uses service role key (bypasses RLS)
   - Performs database queries
   - Filtered by `user.id` from authenticated user

This gives us:
- ✅ Proper authentication (via cookies)
- ✅ Secure database access (via service role)
- ✅ User isolation (filtering by user.id)

## Testing

After this fix:

1. ✅ User can log in
2. ✅ Session cookies are properly read
3. ✅ `/api/campaigns` returns user's campaigns (not 401)
4. ✅ `/api/campaigns/[id]` loads specific campaign (not 401)
5. ✅ Dashboard loads with campaign data

## What You Should See Now

1. Sign in with your account
2. Go to homepage
3. **You should see "Your Campaigns"** section
4. Click on a campaign
5. **Dashboard loads** with:
   - Left panel: AI Chat
   - Right panel: Campaign stepper with 6 steps
6. **No 401 errors in console** ✅

## Verification Steps

1. Clear browser cache
2. Sign in: `jack@jackhunter.com`
3. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/cd4218e0-2eb2-40a0-a27e-817e79b072fd`
4. Open browser console (F12)
5. Check Network tab - should see **200 OK** responses (not 401)

## Additional Notes

### Other API Routes
- `app/api/temp-prompt/route.ts` - No auth needed (intentional, for pre-signup)
- `app/api/chat/route.ts` - May need similar fix if it requires auth
- `app/api/campaigns/[id]/state/route.ts` - Currently no auth check (may want to add)

### Environment Variables Required
Make sure these are set in `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

## Status

✅ **Fix Implemented**  
✅ **ESLint Passed**  
✅ **Ready for Testing**

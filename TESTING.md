- ‚ùå Banner-style layouts with heavy borders
- ‚ùå Images that look like traditional print ads
- ‚ùå Stretched or distorted images
- ‚ùå Text or logos placed at extreme edges

```
1. "Create a coffee shop ad"
2. [After generation] "Make it more cozy and warm"
3. "Add a person in the background"
4. "Can we make this work for Stories too?"
```

**Check**: AI maintains context, provides guidance at each step

### Scenario 2: Brand Consistency
```
1. "Create an ad for my fitness brand, FitLife"
2. [After generation] "Create another one with a different scene but same vibe"
```

**Check**: Remembers brand name, maintains consistent aesthetic

```

**Check**: Generates both, explains adaptation choices

### Scenario 4: Complex Request

2. Review generated image in `/public` folder
3. Check console for any errors during generation

### If safe zone guidance isn't working:
1. Verify tool description in `tools/generate-image-tool.ts`
2. Test with explicit text requests
3. Check that system prompt includes safe zone instructions

### If getting errors:
1. Check terminal for error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Ensure Gemini API key is valid

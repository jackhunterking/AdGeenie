## 🎯 Current Functionality

### User Flow
1. **Step 1**: User sees 6 ad variations → can switch formats → selects one → can edit or regenerate
2. **Step 2**: User targets locations → marks step complete
3. **Step 3**: User defines audience → marks step complete
4. **Step 4**: User sets campaign goal → marks step complete
5. **Step 5**: User sets budget → connects Facebook → reviews → ready to publish

### Navigation
- Click any step to jump to it
- Back button: returns to previous step
- Next button: advances (only enabled when current step is complete)
- Progress bar shows overall completion

### Validation
- Cannot proceed to next step until current is complete
- Publish button only enables when all 5 steps are complete
- Visual indicators show which steps need attention

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
All steps use React Context API:
- `useAdPreview()` - Ad content and publish status
- `useLocation()` - Location targeting
- `useAudience()` - Audience definition
- `useGoal()` - Campaign goals
- `useBudget()` - Budget and account selection

### Completion Logic
```typescript
const steps = [
  {
    id: "ads",
    completed: selectedAdIndex !== null,
    content: /* 6 ad variations */
  },
  {
    id: "location",
    completed: locationState.status === "completed",
    content: <LocationSelectionCanvas />
  },
  {
    id: "audience",
    completed: audienceState.status === "completed",
    content: <AudienceSelectionCanvas />
  },
  {
    id: "goal",
    completed: goalState.status === "completed",
    content: <GoalSelectionCanvas />
  },
  {
    id: "budget",
    completed: budgetState.dailyBudget > 0 && !!budgetState.selectedAccount,
    content: /* budget & publish UI */
  }
]
```

### Event System
Custom events for AI chat integration:
- `openEditInChat` - Prepares chat with variation context
- `sendMessageToAI` - Sends message with reference card

## 🎨 Design Principles Applied

1. **Progressive Disclosure** - One step at a time, clear focus
2. **Visual Feedback** - Loading states, hover effects, completion indicators
3. **Consistent Navigation** - Clear back/next flow
4. **Validation Before Progress** - Cannot skip incomplete steps
5. **Clean Aesthetics** - Modern gradients, smooth animations, proper spacing
6. **User Engagement** - AI chat integration encourages interaction
